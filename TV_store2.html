        <p>During its founding, GMStore was a small commercial company with only forty employees. In 1947, Cho Hongjae, 
           founder of Hyosung Factory Group, invested bilaterally with Samsung. The company began manufacturing electronics 
           in the late 1960s, and its first product was a television set that broadcast in black and white. Samsung Heavy Industries
           has become the sole supplier of liquefied natural gas, after storing a financial value of fifty billion US dollars for 
           Royal Dutch over fifteen years. In 2000 AD, the company opened a computer software branch in the Polish city of Warsaw,
           and this branch became one of the most important software centers on the European continent. In 2010, the company
           announced a ten-year growth strategy centered around five businesses, as these companies focus on biopharmaceuticals.
           During the first quarter of 2012, Samsung Electronics became the largest mobile phone maker in the world in terms of number 
           of sales, surpassing Nokia, which had been a leader in this field since 1998. On September 4, 2012, the company announced 
           that it plans to study all of its Chinese suppliers; This came after potential violations of labor policies emerged. In 2015,
           the company planned to launch a new set of services, and this comes as a result of the success of the new commercial offers 
           presented by the company in the field of information technology. At the end of 2014, the company began selling optical fibers
           to the United States of America through Corning's glass factory. During the year 2007, many problems emerged from the
           company s former lawyer, Kim Yong Chol, after he was involved in bribery and falsification of parliamentary evidence. This 
           means that the company is carrying out a process of exploitation by training lawyers for executives in the work of law so that
           they can be scapegoats in the future. . The company has sponsored many sporting and artistic events and sports clubs, such 
           as Chelsea FC, for ten years since 2005 with its brand.</p>
